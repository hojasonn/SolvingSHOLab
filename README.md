# Solving the Simple Harmonic Oscillator
## An introductory physics lab

In the second part of my introductory physics course at Dordt University, we have a series of pendulum labs aimed at introducing a number of concepts to students: oscillations, general uncertainty analysis, and statistical uncertainty analysis. In introducing the simple pendulum in class, we derive equations of motion from Newton's II Law, and then introduce the small angle approximation so that we can find an analytical solution. In the lab, we also test the deviation from the small angle approximation experimentally, and students see at what point their experimental results begin to deviate from the theoretical prediction derived from the underlying small-angle assumption.

Out of a desire to incoporate more computational material in my labs, and inspired by the [Partnership for Integration of Computation into Undergraduate Physics](https://www.compadre.org/PICUP/resources/), this is a first attempt at a computational activity, building off of student's first exposure to the simple pendulum in lab. Students solve the ordinary differential equation for the simple harmonic oscillator using Euler's method two ways: one with Excel, to acquaint themselves with the method using a familiar software, then again with Python, which provides a better environment to play with the discritization of the numerical solution.
